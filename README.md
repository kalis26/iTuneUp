# iTuneUp
iTuneUp is a Python-powered utility designed to streamline the process of building a rich, Apple-like local music library. It allows users to download songs and albums from YouTube, convert them to high-efficiency `.m4a` audio files **(encoded with the AAC codec)**, and embed rich metadata scraped directly from the Apple Music website ‚Äî including artwork, track listings, and artist details.\
Whether you‚Äôre looking to preserve your favorite albums with authentic presentation, or automate the transformation of YouTube content into Apple Music‚Äìstyle files, **iTuneUp** merges content sourcing, transcoding, and metadata injection into a single intuitive tool.

## Core Features
- Download full albums or individual tracks from YouTube via simple search queries.
- Convert audio streams into `.m4a` (MPEG-4 Part 14) format using the **Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)** codec ‚Äî the same audio compression used by Apple Music.
- Enrich downloaded files with Apple Music metadata, including:
  * Track title
  * Album and artist name
  * Release date
  * Album artwork (632√ó632px high-quality JPEG)
  * Track order, genre, and Apple Music-specific tags
- Automatically name and organize files for proper integration with iTunes or third-party players.
- Create a truly **"Apple Music‚Äìlike" experience** for your local music collection ‚Äî without subscriptions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12+
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) -- for high-accuracy YouTube media downloading
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) -- for audio conversion and stream extraction
- [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/) -- for embedding metadata into `.m4a` files
- Selenium + requests ‚Äì to scrape and retrieve metadata from Apple Music‚Äôs public web pages

## System Requirements
- **Python:** 3.9 or higher
- **Operating System:** Windows 10+ (Linux/macOS support possible with minor tweaks)
- **FFmpeg:** Must be installed and accessible via system PATH
- **Google Chrome:** Required for Apple Music scraping (headless via Selenium)

### Python Dependencies
Install required packages using:
```
pip install yt-dlp selenium mutagen requests
```

## How to run?
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
   
2. Launch the app:
  ```
  python iTuneUp.py
  ```
3. Follow prompts to:
  * Input an Apple Music song or album
  * Provide the artist info (used to find matching Apple Music metadata)
4. iTuneUp will:
  * Download and convert the media to `.m4a`
  * Scrape and match metadata from Apple Music
  * Embed metadata and artwork into each track
5. Final `.m4a` files will be saved in the `{album_name}/` folder in the programs directory, ready to be added to iTunes.

## Use Cases
- Build a curated, metadata-rich `.m4a` library using free online content.
- Sync personalized albums with iTunes, iOS devices, or third-party players.
- Archive rare or live recordings with high-efficiency encoding and clean metadata.
- Combine streaming convenience with local ownership and detailed music info.

## How to Add to iTunes and Sync with iPhone/iPad
Once you've used **iTuneUp** to download and tag `.m4a` tracks with rich metadata, you can seamlessly add them to your iTunes library on PC and sync them to your iPhone or iPad for a native Apple Music‚Äìlike experience.
### 1st - Add Songs to iTunes Library
1. Go to the iTunes <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/65F888B2B2F4A0D0EA005BE5/65F888B35B54CF6A740B68EA/en_US/f344938417f8d295c94901b517e140f1.png" alt="" height="16" width="16" originalimagename="GlobalArt/xicnitns.png"> app on your Windows PC (latest version recommended).

3. Navigate to the `{album_name}/` folder generated by **iTuneUp** (or wherever you chose to save your files).

4. Select the folder containing the album or tracks and click **Select Folder**.

5. iTunes will import the songs, retaining:
  * Track order
  * Album name
  * Artist(s)
  * Artwork
  * Genre

5. By default, iTunes syncs your device whenever you connect it to your computer. If you want iTunes to ask you before syncing, do one of the following:
  * *Require a prompt before syncing this device:* Click Summary, then deselect ‚ÄúAutomatically sync when this [*device*] is connected.‚Äù
  * *Require a prompt before syncing all devices*: Choose Edit > Preferences, click Devices, then select ‚ÄúPrevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically.‚Äù

6. When you‚Äôre ready to sync, click Apply.

<img src="https://support.apple.com/clientside/build/img/tip.svg" height="20px"> **Tip:** To automatically sync a connected device at any time, choose File > Devices > Sync [*device name*].\
\
**WARNING:** If you delete an automatically synced item from your iTunes library, the deleted item is removed from your device the next time you sync.

### 3rd - Enjoy Your Music on Your iPhone/iPad
- Once syncing is complete, open the Music app on your iPhone or iPad.
  
- Navigate to: **Library > Albums**
  
- You‚Äôll see the newly added album with full Apple-style formatting: proper cover art, album info, and track structure.

üéâ Congratulations! You now have YouTube-sourced music enriched with **Apple Music metadata** on your iPhone ‚Äî **no subscriptions required**, and fully integrated with iTunes' ecosystem.
